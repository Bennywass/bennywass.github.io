            <p class="description-text">This is a super simple and easy to prepare dish. It should only take about 30 minutes to prepare and by the end of it, you'll have some of the best fried rice you'll ever have. Now, I don’t expect people to read much beyond the top text, so I’ll just ramble on about something random. Did you know that the swivel chair was invented by Thomas Jefferson? It's true, look it up! Anyways, I can’t confirm if the next thing I’m about to say is true, but I’m pretty sure Thomas Jefferson was a big fan of my fried rice as well. So if you like former president Thomas Jefferson, then you’ll love this rice.</p>

        <h2 class="title">How To Prepare</h2>
        <div>
            <p class="prep-text">Step 1: In a small pot combine 1 cup of rice, 1 1/2 cups of water and butter. Set heat to high and let it bring to a boil. As soon as the water starts boiling, lower the heat to a simmer, cover the pot, and let it sit for 15 minutes. </p>
            <p class="prep-text">Step 2: After 15 minutes, turn off the burner and let the rice sit for about 5 minutes. Once the timer is up, you remove the lid and fluff the rice.</p>
            <p class="prep-text">Step 3: peel the carrot and the cut into small bite sized portions. You'll want the pieces to be generally the same size. </p>
            <p class="prep-text">Step 4: Cut your bacon into small portions. About half an inch in length will do.</p>
            <p class="prep-text">Step 5: Crack the eggs into a small bowl and mix. I feel like I don't need to say this, but please make sure there are no egg shells inside the bowl when mixing. Stir the eggs with all your might, without spilling any of it. Eventually it'll be a gooey, yellow substance. This is what you want.</p>
            <p class="prep-text">Step 6: in a small pan, get a small spoonful of coconut oil and wait for it to melt at about medium heat. Once the oil has melted and there's a bit of smoke, it is probably a good time to start cooking the eggs. Pour eggs onto the pan and stir constantly until the eggs are fully cooked. Then remove eggs from heat.</p>
            <p class="prep-text">Step 7: In a new pan, or the same one you cooked eggs in if you only have one pan, preheat at medium heat. Once heated, add bacon. The step here is practically the same as the eggs; stir until cooked.</p>
            <p class="prep-text">Step 8: In a pot, wok, pan, or whatever you want to use, heat a slightly bigger spoonful of coconut oil on medium heat. Once heated, cook the carrots until carrots are a little bit soft, but not too soft. I'll let you be the judge on that one.</p>
            <p class="prep-text">Step 9: Once carrots are cooked, dump the rice into the same device you used to cook the carrots in. Add more coconut oil if needed.</p>
            <p class="prep-text">Step 10: Mix together for a minute before dumping  some soy sauce in there. You'll notice that I didn't give a measurement on how much soy sauce to use. This was done on purpose. Nobody measures this kind of thing. You just gotta eyeball it really. Make sure it fully coats the rice, but don't add so much that it becomes a soup. Add to taste.</p>
            <p class="prep-text">Step 11: Stirein bacon and eggs. let it cook for a few minutes and boom! Your done. Enjoy!</p>
