            <p>Benjamin Raymond Wassum was born in Roanoke, VA in the year 2002. He was the 4th child in a family of 7 children. Ben had always wanted to create his own cooking website... Well, not really. But he did think it would be a fun idea to try. Cooking was something Ben always wanted to try, but never got around doing. However, everything changed when he was forced into quarantine. To distract himself from the excruciating boredom, Ben decided to take the opportunity to finally try out cooking. Ben quickly fell in love with the activity, always trying to find new and creative recipes to expand his culinary expeditions. Jump a few years and Ben is given an assignment; he has to build a personal website. Ben struggled to think of ideas at first. But, in a moment of pure inspiration, Ben thought to himself, “I guess I can do a cooking site.” And the rest is history. Ben’s website quickly became the most visited website in all of the internet, winning a few awards along the way. Ben now sits atop of a pile of gold, gladly giving aways his riches to all those that can solve his riddles three.</p>
