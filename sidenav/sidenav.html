    <p>There are many things that can be done with a sidenav. You can make links and have them not take too much space... That's about all I got with that one. Maybe there's more that can be done, I'm not sure. I wrote this text in 5 minutes. Perhaps you can hide all sorts of secrets withing the text of these sidenavs. Now, I won't be able to go into too much detail, because I may land myself into legal trouble. But let's just say that the police won't be able to find what you are hiding in those sidenavs.</p>
