            <h2 class="big_text">Audience:</h2>
            <p class="text">The intended audience will be people who are wanting simple, easy to do recipes with a bit of humor sprinkled throughout. 
                It's for people who find it annoying to have to scroll through 4 paragraphs of the writer telling their life's story before showing you how to prepare the meal. 
                My site will be poking fun at these sites, while also providing delicious recipes. So for people who are wanting a good laugh and a good meal at the same time, my site is a great place to stop.

            <h2 class="big_text">Why Come Here?</h2>
            <p>I think a major issue with a lot of cooking sites is they always feel clunky to use and have way too much erroneous dialogue. I want to be very direct where the user will be able to find what they need and not waste their time. I want to get right into it and give actual practical cooking advice. At the same time of giving the recipes, I will be sprinkling in some dry humor here and there to keep it fun for the users. I mainly just want a cooking website that isn’t boring and filled with ads. That’s another annoying thing with most cooking sites, the amount of ads that fill the screen, or the calls to action that they have, such as the prompts to sign up for some newsletter. It makes it hard for me to actually use cooking sites. To end this, my site will be a simple, easy to use site that cuts out a lot of the fat that most cooking sites suffer from. That’s why people should use my site.

        <h2 class="big_text">What Can You Find?</h2>
        <p>On the site, there is really one thing of interest, which are the recipes. I currently plan on providing 4 recipes from my backlog. I've already listed the 4 that I am planning on using in the “Purpose” statement, but I’ll reiterate. I will be writing recipes for Fried Rice, Chicken Cordon Bleu, Korean Beef, and Chicken Sandwiches. Each recipe will have its own subpage where they can find out how to prepare the meal. It will include a breakdown of the ingredients needed (And alternatives, if needed), how to cut, chop, and fry the ingredients into a delicious meal. I want each recipe to be easy to follow and shouldn’t have any confusion on what some of the wording actually means. In the breakdown of each recipe, I will be describing how to prepare the meals for people who are new to cooking and will have sarcastic remarks about the “proper” way to cook. There will also be an  “About me” page, which will have a brief, but silly description of myself. It will be semi sarcastic and not really informative about who I am. Lastly, there will be a “Contact Us” page in the footer. I probably won’t have actual contact info, I’ll most likely make a joke out of it. 
        </p>
        <div class="Where"></div>
        <h2 class="big_text">How To Navigate</h2>
        <p>On the front page, I want a header that has links to the home page, an about me page, and a link that takes you to the recipes. The recipes link won’t take you to a subpage, but instead it will drag you down the page to where the recipes are located. Down the page, I will have a grid that lists the four recipes and a picture to represent them. Also included will be a short description of each meal listed. When clicking on the listing of the meal, it will take the user to a subpage where the specificities of the recipe will be described. Further down the website, we will have the footer. It will just be the year the website was designed and will have a “contact us” link, which will take the user to a subpage that has some contact info on it.  Navigating the subpages should also be fairly easy to maneuver as well. For example: on a recipe subpage, There will be a brief description of the meal before going straight into the ingredients list and then finally how to prepare. I plan on making the ingredients list inside its own little box, separate from the rest of the page, to make it easy for the user to reference the ingredients, without the need to sift through text.
