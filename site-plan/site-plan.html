            <h2 class="big_text">Audience:</h2>
            <p class="text">The intended audience will be people who are wanting simple, easy to do recipes with a bit of humor sprinkled throughout. 
                It's for people who find it annoying to have to scroll through 4 paragraphs of the writer telling their life's story before showing you how to prepare the meal. 
                My site will be poking fun at these sites, while also providing delicious recipes. So for people who are wanting a good laugh and a good meal at the same time, my site is a great place to stop.
